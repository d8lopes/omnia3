# GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
GDPR compliance has been a priority for OMNIA since it's release and below is the list of topics and measures that were developed in order to comply with it's regulation.

## Sensitive Data
OMNIA allows for attribute data classification as "sensitive", allowing the organization's DPO (Data Protection Officer) to be able to destroy it when/if necessary.

Defining an attribute as "sensitive" requires 2 steps:

	 - Access the "Modeler" dashboard;
	 - Find and access the attribute you need and activate the "Is sensitive?" option;
 
The role of DPO has unique access to the "Destroy Sensitive Data" option, that's located at the bottom left corner of every document, under the menu "More Options". Using this feature guarantees the immediate destruction of the document's sensitive data, immediately and irreversibly.
 
## Encryption
Data encryption is mandatory for GDPR compliance and, to that effect, two elements need to be encrypted from the start:

	- Database;
	- Attachments Storage;

 

## Logging
OMNIA logs every single database request and every single login attempt in its log files.

Access to these documents requires an enquiry to the system's administrator.

## Production Environment
Our platform's production environment's infrastructure is built to support Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).
